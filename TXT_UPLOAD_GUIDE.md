# üìÑ TXT File Upload Guide

## Quick Start - Much Faster! ‚ö°

Instead of waiting for Whisper AI to transcribe your video, you can now **upload a TXT file** with your script. This is **much faster** and gives you full control!

---

## How It Works

### Step 1: Prepare Your TXT File

Create a simple text file (`.txt`) with your script. Example:

**my_script.txt:**
```
Look, if you're suffering from neuropathy, I need to ask you three quick questions. I need you to answer them honestly. Because what I'm about to reveal could explain why nothing you've tried has ever worked. Question 1. Is your pain worse at night when you lie down?
```

**Tips:**
- ‚úÖ Just plain text, no special formatting needed
- ‚úÖ Separate sentences with spaces or punctuation
- ‚úÖ Words will be automatically distributed across your video duration
- ‚úÖ No need for timestamps - the system handles that!

---

### Step 2: Upload Both Files

1. **Choose Video File** - Select your main video (MP4, AVI, MOV, etc.)
2. **Choose TXT File** - Select your script file (.txt)
3. **Click "Upload & Process"**

That's it! ‚ö° **Much faster than Whisper AI!**

---

### Step 3: Select Text & Add Clips

Once uploaded, you'll see your script as clickable words:

1. **Click and drag** to select words (e.g., "suffering from neuropathy")
2. **Upload a video clip** or **audio file** for that highlight
3. **Click "Add Highlight"**
4. Repeat for more subtitles!

---

## Example Workflow

### Your TXT File:
```
Look if you're suffering from neuropathy I need to ask you three quick questions
```

### After Upload:
The words appear clickable in the interface:
```
[Look] [if] [you're] [suffering] [from] [neuropathy] [I] [need] [to] [ask] [you] [three] [quick] [questions]
```

### Select & Add Clips:
1. Select: "suffering from neuropathy" ‚Üí Upload `neuropathy_visual.mp4`
2. Select: "three quick questions" ‚Üí Upload `questions_audio.mp3`
3. Click "Process Video"
4. Download your edited video!

## TXT File Format

### ‚úÖ Good Examples:

**Simple script:**
```
Hello everyone welcome to my channel today we're talking about health
```

**With punctuation:**
```
Look, if you're suffering from neuropathy, I need to ask you three quick questions. I need you to answer them honestly.
```

**Multiple sentences:**
```
Question 1. Is your pain worse at night?
Question 2. Do you feel tingling in your feet?
Question 3. Have you tried everything?
```

### ‚ùå Avoid:

**Don't include timestamps:**
```
‚ùå [00:00] Hello everyone
‚ùå 0:05 - Welcome to my channel
```

**Don't use special formatting:**
```
‚ùå **Bold text**
‚ùå *Italic text*
‚ùå # Headers
```

**Don't use line breaks for timing:**
```
‚ùå Hello
   everyone
   welcome
```

Just use **plain text** with normal spacing!

---

## How Words Are Timed

The system automatically distributes words evenly across your video:

**Example:**
- Video duration: 10 seconds
- Script: "Hello everyone welcome to my channel" (6 words)
- Each word gets: 10 √∑ 6 = ~1.67 seconds

**Word Timing:**
- "Hello" ‚Üí 0.00 - 1.67s
- "everyone" ‚Üí 1.67 - 3.34s
- "welcome" ‚Üí 3.34 - 5.01s
- "to" ‚Üí 5.01 - 6.68s
- "my" ‚Üí 6.68 - 8.35s
- "channel" ‚Üí 8.35 - 10.00s

This ensures smooth, evenly-paced subtitles!

## Tips for Best Results

### 1. Match Your Video
Make sure your TXT file matches what's actually said in the video (or close to it).

### 2. Keep It Simple
Just write the words as they're spoken. No need for:
- Timestamps
- Speaker names
- Sound effects descriptions
- Stage directions

### 3. Use Proper Spacing
Separate words with spaces, sentences with periods or commas.

### 4. Check Word Count
The system will tell you how many words were found. Make sure it looks right!

---

## Troubleshooting

### "No words found"
- Make sure your TXT file isn't empty
- Check that it's actually a `.txt` file, not `.doc` or `.pdf`
- Try opening it in Notepad to verify the content

### "Words don't match video"
- The TXT file should contain the actual spoken words
- Words are distributed evenly, so timing might not be perfect
- For precise timing, you'd need to use Whisper AI or manual timestamps

### "File upload failed"
- Make sure the file is `.txt` format
- Check that the file isn't too large (should be small for text)
- Try saving it with UTF-8 encoding

---

## Example: Complete Workflow

### 1. Create TXT File
**script.txt:**
```
Look if you're suffering from neuropathy I need to ask you three quick questions
```

### 2. Upload Files
- Video: `my_video.mp4`
