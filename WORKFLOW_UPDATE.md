# ✅ Updated Workflow: Free Word Selection with Subtitle Organization

## 🎯 What Changed?

Based on your feedback, the workflow now provides **maximum flexibility**:

### ✅ What You Can Do Now:

1. **Select ANY words** - Single word, multiple words, entire lines, across multiple lines
2. **Assign multiple clips to one subtitle line** - Select different word ranges within the same subtitle
3. **Assign one clip across multiple subtitle lines** - Select words that span multiple subtitles
4. **Subtitle lines are for ORGANIZATION ONLY** - They just show the structure from your TXT file

---

## 📋 How It Works

### Step 1: Upload Video + TXT File

Your TXT file with line breaks:
```
Look if you're suffering from neuropathy I need to ask you three quick questions
I need you to answer them honestly
Because what I'm about to reveal could explain why nothing you've tried has ever worked
```

### Step 2: See Your Subtitle Organization

At the top, you'll see **subtitle summary boxes** showing the line structure:

```
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ #1  "Look if you're suffering from neuropathy..."  │
│     Words 1-15                                     │
├────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ #2  "I need you to answer them honestly"          │
│     Words 16-22                                    │
├────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ #3  "Because what I'm about to reveal could..."   │
│     Words 23-38                                    │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Step 3: Select Words Freely

Below the summary, you'll see the **full transcript with selectable words**:

```
┌─ Subtitle #1 ──────────────────────────────────────┐
│ [Look] [if] [you're] [suffering] [from] ...        │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

┌─ Subtitle #2 ──────────────────────────────────────┐
│ [I] [need] [you] [to] [answer] [them] [honestly]  │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

┌─ Subtitle #3 ──────────────────────────────────────┐
│ [Because] [what] [I'm] [about] [to] [reveal] ...  │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Selection Methods:**
- **Click and drag** - Select multiple consecutive words
- **Shift + Click** - Extend selection to clicked word
- **Click single word** - Select just one word

### Step 4: Assign Clips to Selected Words

After selecting words:
1. Choose a video clip or audio file
2. Set the volume
3. Click "Add Highlight"
4. Repeat for any other word selections!

## 🎨 Example Use Cases

### Example 1: Multiple Clips in One Subtitle

**Subtitle #1:** "Look if you're suffering from neuropathy I need to ask you three quick questions"

You can assign:
- **Clip A** to words "Look if you're suffering" (words 1-4)
- **Clip B** to words "from neuropathy" (words 5-6)
- **Clip C** to words "I need to ask you three quick questions" (words 7-15)

All three clips are in the same subtitle line!

### Example 2: One Clip Across Multiple Subtitles

**Subtitle #1:** "Look if you're suffering from neuropathy I need to ask you three quick questions"
**Subtitle #2:** "I need you to answer them honestly"

You can assign:
- **Clip A** to words "three quick questions I need you to answer" (spans from end of subtitle #1 to middle of subtitle #2)

### Example 3: Single Word Clips

You can assign a clip to just one word:
- **Clip A** to word "neuropathy" (word 6)
- **Clip B** to word "honestly" (word 22)
