## Color Guide

| 🟡 Yellow with glow | Currently selected |
| 🟢 Green with glow | Already has a highlight assigned |
| ⚪ White/Default | Not selected, available |

## What Happens After Selection?

1. **Selected text appears below the transcript:**
   ```
   Selected Text: "suffering from neuropathy"
   ```

2. **Upload or select a clip/audio file**

3. **Click "Add Highlight"**

4. **The words turn GREEN** to show they're assigned

5. **You can't select green words again** (they're already used)

---

## Tips for Best Results

✅ **DO:**
- Select complete phrases (e.g., "suffering from neuropathy")
- Select 2-10 words per highlight for best subtitle readability
- Make sure your selection makes sense as a subtitle

❌ **DON'T:**
- Select words that are already green (already assigned)
- Select too many words (subtitles will be too long)
- Overlap selections (each word can only have one highlight)

---

## Example Workflow

**Transcript:**
```
Look, if you're suffering from neuropathy, I need to ask you three quick questions.
```

**Selection 1:**
1. Click and drag: "suffering from neuropathy"
2. Upload clip: `clips/neuropathy_visual.mp4`
3. Add Highlight → Words turn green ✅

**Selection 2:**
1. Click and drag: "three quick questions"
2. Upload audio: `audio_files/dramatic_music.mp3`
3. Add Highlight → Words turn green ✅

**Result:**
```
Look, if you're [suffering from neuropathy], I need to ask you [three quick questions].
                  ↑ Green (has clip)                        ↑ Green (has audio)
```

## Troubleshooting

**"I can't select a word"**
- It's probably already green (already assigned to a highlight)
- Remove the existing highlight first, then select again

**"Selection is jumping around"**
- Make sure you're holding the mouse button down while dragging
- Try the Shift+Click method instead

**"I selected the wrong words"**
- Click "Cancel" to clear the selection
- Start over with a new selection

**"Words aren't turning yellow"**
- Make sure you're clicking directly on the words
- Check that the words aren't already green (assigned)
- Refresh the page if needed

## Keyboard Shortcuts

| Action | Shortcut |
|--------|----------|
| Extend selection | Hold **Shift** + Click |
| Cancel selection | Click **Cancel** button |
| Clear all | Refresh page (F5) |

---

## Advanced: Selecting Non-Consecutive Words

**Currently NOT supported:**
```
❌ [Look] if you're [suffering] from [neuropathy]
   (Can't skip words in between)
```

**Workaround:**
Create separate highlights:
```
✅ Highlight 1: "Look"
✅ Highlight 2: "suffering from neuropathy"
```

Each highlight can have its own clip/audio!

Happy selecting! 🎬✨
